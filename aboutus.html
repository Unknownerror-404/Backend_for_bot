            <h3>👨‍💻 Who We Are</h3>
            <p>We are a dedicated group of four Second-year Computer Engineering students from Pimpri Chinchwad College of Engineering and Research (PCCOE&R), Pune. As part of our subject Community Engagement Program, we have collaborated to solve a real-world problem using technology and creativity. Despite being in the early stages of our academic journey, our team shares a strong passion for building impactful tech solutions</p>

            <h3>🏡 Our Background</h3>
            <p>
            Although we all belong to different cities of Maharashtra, we came together at PCCOE&R, Pune with a shared passion for technology and innovation. Coming from varied schooling backgrounds and small towns, each of us brings a unique set of ideas, experiences, and motivation. This diversity has helped us look at problems from multiple perspectives and build more practical, people-focused solutions. Our goal has always been to use what we learn in class and turn it into something real that can help society — and AarogyaAI is our first step in that direction.

            <h3>🧠 What is AarogyaAI?</h3>
            <p>
                Our project, AarogyaAI, is an AI-based health chatbot designed to give users quick and trustworthy responses to basic medical queries. It acts as a virtual first-aid assistant that provides information about common symptoms, diseases, and health precautions.
            </p>
            <p>
                In rural and semi-urban areas, people often don’t have quick access to medical consultation. They either ignore their symptoms or rely on unverified internet sources. AarogyaAI is our solution to bridge that gap by providing basic healthcare awareness instantly, anytime, anywhere.
